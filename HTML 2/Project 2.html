           <p>The world is full of fascinating places. Planning the perfect vacation involves packing up, leaving home, and experiencing something new.

               <li><h2>Florence, Italy</h2></li>
               <p>A city-size shrine to the Renaissance, Florence offers frescoes, sculptures, churches, 
                   palaces, and other monuments from the richest cultural flowering the world has known. 
                   Names from its dazzling historical past; Dante, Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelliare are 
                   some of the most resonant of the medieval age. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destination/florence">Learn More</a>.

                <li><h2>Beijing, China</h2></li>
                <p>A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the 2008
                     Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports
                      venues seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China 
                      remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital
                       still on view in the famed Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer Palace.

                <li><h2>Seoul, South Korea</h2></li>
                <p>The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the shadow of 
                    21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising 
                    in the city center complete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples nestling 
                    among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and 
                    peddlers, while tiny neighborhoods of traditionalcottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments
